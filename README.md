### I make things, some better then others, but all open-source!

I'm a a mechanical engineer who escaped CAD and found `git`.  I work primarily on
CircuitPython, with a focus on writing hardware driviers, improving documentation,
and maintaining codebase infrastructure.

*Sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython!*

subjects! Let me know if you want to collaborate!
