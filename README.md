I make things, some better then others, but all open-source!

I'm a a mechanical engineer who escaped CAD and found `git`.  I work primarily on
CircuitPython, with a focus on writing hardware driviers, improving documentation,
and maintaining codebase infrastructure.

My passions are robotics and automation, and I'm always up for contributing to these
subjects! Let me know if you want to collaborate!

Some of my more notable libraries are pinned.
