### I make things, some better then others, but most open-source!

I'm a mechanical engineer and software developer who escaped CAD and found `git`.  I work primarily on
CircuitPython, with a focus on writing hardware driviers, improving documentation,
and maintaining codebase infrastructure.

*Sponsored by Adafruit to work on CircuitPython!*

### Talk to me about...

My passions are robotics and automation, and I'm always up for contributing to these
subjects! Let me know if you want to collaborate!
